Description: # autovar
        Analysis script for sources with variability in their brightness
        
        ## Installation
        
        It is strongly recommended you use python 3 and a virtual environment
        
        Using the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) distribution of Python:
        
        ```bash
        conda create -n autovar python=3
        source activate autovar
        ```
        
        The package can be installed with `pip`. From the root of this repo, run:
        
        ```bash
        pip install .
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        There are a few input options when running the scripts. You can either run the whole analysis at once or the individual stages.
        
        `--ra` *[required parameter]* Right Ascension of the target (in decimal)
        
        `--dec` *[required parameter]* Declination of the target (in decimal)
        
        `--target-file` *[required parameter]*
        
        `--indir` [parameter] Path of directory containing LCO data files. If none is given, autovar assumes the current directory
        
        `--format` [parameter] input file format. If not `fz`, `fits`, or `fit` assumes the input files are photometry files with correct headers. If image files given, code will extra photometry from FITS extension. Defaults to `fz`.
        
        `--full` [boolean flag] Run the whole code. This will run the following steps in this order `stars` > `comparison` > `calc` > `plot`
        
        `--stars` [boolean flag] Step 1: Identify and match stars from each data file
        
        `--comparison` [boolean flag] Step 2: Identify non-varying stars to use for comparisons
        
        `--calc` [boolean flag] Step 3: Calculate the brightness change of the target
        
        `--plot` [boolean flag] Step 4: Produce lightcurve plots
        
        `--eebls` [boolean flag] Additional step: EEBLS - box fitting to search for periodic transits
        
        `--clean` [boolean flag] Remove all files except the original data files
        
        
        ### Example Usage
        
        ```bash
        autovar --ra 154.9083708 --dec -9.8062778 --indir /path/to/your/data --full
        ```
        
        All the files generated will be stored in the directory you specify in `--indir`
        
        ### Tests
        
        If you are developing this package, you will want to run the tests. You will need `pytest` installed and then, from the `autovar` directory within this repo, run:
        
        ```bash
        pytest
        ```
        
        To suppress the warning messages use:
        
        ```bash
        pytest --disable-pytest-warnings
        ```
